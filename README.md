- `app.log` file
- Console output
- Includes timestamps, levels, and detailed error information

## Security Features

- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection via form tokens
- Rate limiting ready (can be easily added)
- Environment variable protection

## Production Deployment

### Docker (Recommended)

Create a `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Environment Variables for Production

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
APP_PORT=8000
DEBUG=False
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
```

### Reverse Proxy Configuration (Nginx)

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# With auto-reload
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# With debug logging
python app.py
```

### Testing

The application includes comprehensive error handling and validation. For testing:

1. Test with various transcript lengths
2. Test with special characters and formatting
3. Test API endpoints with curl or Postman
4. Verify CSV output format and data integrity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify your Groq API key is valid
   - Check the `.env` file configuration
   - Ensure no rate limits are exceeded

2. **Import Errors**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is being used
   - Check virtual environment activation

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the port in app.py or use: `uvicorn app:app --port 8001`

4. **CSV File Issues**
   - Check write permissions in the application directory
   - Verify no other processes are using the CSV file

### Performance Optimization

- Use Redis for caching API responses
- Implement connection pooling for database storage
- Add CDN for static assets
- Use Gunicorn with multiple workers for production
